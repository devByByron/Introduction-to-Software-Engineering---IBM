- System / Software Architect – Designs the overall structure of the system, choosing technologies, patterns, and ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- UX Designer – Focuses on user research, wireframes, and design to ensure the product is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing.
- Software Developer – Writes the actual code, implements features, fixes bugs, and collaborates on solutions with the team.
- QA / Tester – Validates that the software meets requirements by running manual and automated tests; ensures quality and reliability.
- SRE / Ops Engineer – Manages infrastructure, deployment, and system reliability; monitors performance and handles incident response.
- Product Manager / Owner – Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, manages the backlog, and aligns the team with business goals.

- **Advanced Styling**: SASS, LESS  
- **Frameworks**: Angular, React, Vue  
- **Approaches**: Adaptive vs Responsive

## 🤝 What is Pair Programming?
- **Driver/Navigator**  
- **Ping-Pong (TDD-based)**  
- **Strong Style (mentor/learner)**  

✅ Benefits: Knowledge sharing, better code, soft skills  
⚠️ Challenges: Fatigue, dominance, scheduling conflicts  

## 👥 Pair Programming Styles

### 1. Driver / Navigator
- **Driver**  
  - The one typing the code.  
  - Focuses on the mechanics (syntax, structure, implementation).  

- **Navigator**  
  - Reviews in real time.  
  - Thinks about direction, catches mistakes, considers design, architecture, and edge cases.  

🔄 They **swap roles regularly** to keep both developers engaged.  

---

### 2. Ping-Pong (TDD-based)
- Based on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. Developer A writes a **failing test**.  
  2. Developer B writes the **code to make it pass**.  
  3. Developer B then writes the **next failing test**.  
  4. Developer A writes the **code to pass it**.  

⚡ Keeps both developers active and ensures **tests drive the design**.  

---

### 3. Strong Style (Mentor/Learner)
- Popularized by **Llewellyn Falco**.  
- **Rule**:  
  > “For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands.”  

- **Used in Mentorship**:  
  - **Mentor (Navigator):** Guides, explains concepts, suggests approaches.  
  - **Learner (Driver):** Writes the actual code, gaining hands-on experience.  

✅ Ensures the learner is **actively coding**, not just watching.  


---

## 🚀 CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Delivery/Deployment)
- **CI**: Frequent merges, automated builds/tests  
- **CD**: Automated deploys to staging/production  

**Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel, WebAssembly  
**Package Managers**: npm, Pip, Maven, Homebrew, etc.  

---

## 🏗️ What is a Software Stack?
A combination of front-end, back-end, database, and infrastructure technologies.  

**Popular Stacks**  
- **LAMP** – Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP  
- **MEAN** – MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js  
- **MERN** – MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js  
- **MEVN** – MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js  
- **Python-Django** – Python, Django, SQL  
- **Ruby on Rails** – Ruby, Rails, SQL  

✅ Benefits: Fast dev, reusable code, open-source support  
⚠️ Challenges: Scalability, ecosystem maturity, dependency management

**High-Level vs. Low-Level Programming Languages**

High-Level Languages

Use English-like syntax, easy to read, write, and debug.

Portable across platforms.

Examples: SQL, Pascal, Python.

Low-Level Languages

Closer to machine code, harder for humans to read.

Tied to specific hardware architectures.

Example: Assembly (ARM, MIPS, X86).

Query Languages

Specialized languages for interacting with databases.

Perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Require database and application to use compatible syntax.

Examples: SQL (most common), AQL, CQL, Datalog.

Assembly Languages

Low-level programming language using mnemonics (short codes) to represent machine instructions.

Hardware-specific: each CPU has its own assembly language.

Requires an assembler to convert code into machine instructions.

One assembly instruction usually equals one machine instruction.


Key Programming Logic Concepts
1. Boolean Expressions and Variables

Boolean Expression: A statement that evaluates to either true or false.

Variable: Holds a value that can change based on user input, program conditions, or previous outputs.

Role in Programming: Boolean logic and variables help computers make decisions and control program flow.

2. Branching (Decision-Making Logic)

Definition: Program chooses different paths of execution based on conditions.

How It Works: Evaluates a condition → follows one branch if true, another if false.

Branching Statements (Constructs):

if → Executes code only if condition is true.

if-then-else → Executes one block if true, another if false.

switch → Chooses a path based on multiple possible values of a variable/expression.

GoTo → Jumps to another line in code (less common today).

Use Case: Deciding what action to take.

3. Looping (Repetition Logic)

Definition: A set of instructions repeats until a condition is met.

How It Works: Performs a process → checks condition → repeats if condition still holds.

Loop Types:

While loop → Checks condition before each iteration (entry-controlled).

For loop → Runs a fixed number of times based on a counter.

Do-while loop → Executes at least once, checks condition after (exit-controlled).

Use Case: Deciding how many times to perform an action.

Difference Between Branching and Looping

Branching: Controls which path the program takes.

Looping: Controls how many times an action repeats.

Programming Concepts

1. Identifiers

Definition: A custom name that references a program component (e.g., value, method, interface, or class).

Purpose: Makes code easier to read, maintain, and reuse.

2. Constants

Definition: An identifier whose value does not change during program execution.

Examples: Pi, tax_rate, cost_price.

Benefits:

Improves readability (meaningful names instead of raw numbers).

Easier to update (change the constant once instead of in multiple places).

3. Variables

Definition: An identifier whose value can change during execution.

Examples: age, username, high_score.

Purpose: Useful for storing unknown or user-input values.

Declaration: Can assign a data type and value immediately, or leave uninitialized for later assignment.

4. Containers

Definition: Special identifiers that store multiple elements.

Purpose: More efficient than declaring many separate variables.

Array

Fixed size container storing elements of the same type.

Sequential order, indexed from 0.

Example: Storing 6 integers in one array instead of 6 separate variables.

Vector

Dynamic size container (grows/shrinks automatically).

Also called a dynamic array.

Uses more memory and is slower than arrays since data isn’t always in sequential memory.

No need to define maximum size at declaration.

Key Takeaways

Identifiers → Names for program components.

Constants → Fixed values.

Variables → Changeable values.

Arrays → Fixed-size collections.

Vectors → Dynamic-size collections.
