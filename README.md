Software development today is guided by the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  

**Phases**: Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance  

<img width="241" height="283" alt="SDLC" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcde7e75-52b1-4b2d-829a-21aa5923d114" />  


**Planning** - In the planning phase, requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented, leading to the creation of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

**Design** - The design phase involves developing the software architecture based on the SRS, with prototypes created for stakeholder feedback.

**Development** - The development phase is where coding occurs, guided by the design document, using various programming tools and languages.

**Testing** - The testing phase ensures the code is stable and meets requirements, involving different testing levels like unit and integration testing.

**Deployment** - Deployment involves releasing the application to users, often in stages.

**Maintenance** - Addresses bugs and gathers user feedback for future improvements.

---

## 🧩 Common Software Engineering Processes
The software development process typically involves **six key stages**:

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- Process of collecting and documenting the set of requirements the software must meet  
- Results in a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
- Often includes **use cases** describing business needs and user flows  
- Requirements fall into four main categories:
  - **Functional**
  - **External & UI**
  - **System Features**
  - **Non-Functional**

---

### 2. Software Design
- Transforms requirements into a structure that can be implemented in code  
- Defines the **system architecture**, component boundaries, and interactions  
- Covers:
  - Business rules and application logic  
  - API design  
  - User Interface and database design  
  - Performance, security, and platform considerations  
- Goal: Translate requirements into a **software solution blueprint**

---

### 3. Coding for Quality

## 📝 Welcome to Requirements

**Requirements Gathering Process**

Steps: Identify stakeholders → Define goals → Set objectives → Elicit → Document → Confirm/Prioritize  

## 1. Identify Stakeholders
**Purpose:** Find everyone who is affected by or cares about the project (e.g., users, sponsors, developers, vendors).

**Activities:**
- Review org charts and conduct stakeholder interviews.
- Create a stakeholder map (influence vs interest).
- Build a contact list.

**Output:** *Stakeholder Register* (names, roles, influence, communication needs).

**Tip:** Include frontline users early — they usually know hidden needs.

---

## 2. Define Goals
**Purpose:** Capture high-level business outcomes (why the project exists).

**Activities:**
- Workshop with sponsors.
- Write a problem statement.
- Define success metrics.

**Output:** *Goal Statement* and measurable success criteria (KPIs).

**Tip:** Make goals business-facing — e.g., “Reduce onboarding time by 30% within 6 months.”

---

## 3. Set Objectives
**Purpose:** Convert goals into clear, measurable outcomes.

**Activities:**
- Create SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
- Assign targets, owners, and deadlines.

**Output:** *List of Objectives* with metrics and constraints.

**Tip:** Attach a measurable metric to each objective.

---

## 4. Elicit Requirements
**Purpose:** Gather functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders.

**Techniques:**
- Interviews and workshops (JAD sessions)
- Surveys and observations
- Prototyping and user journey mapping

**Output:** *Raw requirements* (notes, user stories, use cases, prototypes).

**Tip:** Use multiple methods and ask open-ended questions.

---

## 5. Document Requirements
**Purpose:** Organize and formalize all gathered information.

**Activities:**
- Write user stories, use cases, and functional specs.
- Define acceptance criteria.
- Create wireframes and assign unique requirement IDs.

**Output:** *Functional Requirements Document (FRD)*, *Product Requirements Document (PRD)*, or *System Requirements Specification (SRS)*.

**Tip:** Use clear language and visuals to prevent ambiguity.

---

## 6. Confirm & Prioritize
**Purpose:** Validate and prioritize requirements with stakeholders.

**Activities:**
- Conduct review sessions and walkthroughs.
- Apply prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, Value vs Effort, WSJF).
- Record approvals and sign-offs.

**Output:** *Approved & prioritized requirements list* and *Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)*.

**Tip:** Document all trade-offs and ensure alignment before development starts.




**Key Requirement Documents**  
- **SRS** (Software Requirement Specification) - Captures software functionalities and performance benchmarks, including functional, external, system features, and non-functional requirements.
- **URS** (User Requirement Specification) - Outlines user stories, detailing who the user is, what functions are needed, and why.  
- **SysRS** (System Requirement Specification) - Broader than the SRS, detailing system capabilities, interfaces, user characteristics, and various requirements including policy and performance criteria.

## ⚙️ Software Development Methodologies Overview
- **Waterfall Model** – Sequential, rigid, long release cycles  
- **V-Shape Model** – Emphasizes testing, rigid  
- **Agile Model** – Iterative, flexible, feedback-driven


**Waterfall Method**

A sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins, with all planning done upfront.
The customer typically sees the product only during the testing phase, leading to long intervals between releases.

**V-shape Model**

Similar to Waterfall but emphasizes verification and validation phases, forming a V shape.
Each verification phase corresponds to a validation phase, with distinct stages for planning, design, coding, and testing.

**Agile Method**

An iterative approach that promotes collaboration and short development cycles (sprints), allowing for ongoing feedback and adjustments.
Agile focuses on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly, with core values emphasizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change.


---

## 🧪 Software Testing
- **Functional Testing** – Involves black box testing, focusing on inputs and outputs without examining the internal code. It ensures the software meets functional requirements and handles user errors appropriately. (verifies requirements)  
- **Non-Functional Testing** – Evaluates attributes like performance, security, and scalability. It assesses how the software behaves under stress and its consistency across different environments. (performance, scalability, security)  
- **Regression Testing** – Confirms that recent changes, such as bug fixes, do not negatively impact existing functionality. It involves selecting and prioritizing test cases based on various factors.(ensures new changes don’t break old features)

<img width="567" height="374" alt="Testing Levels" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06032f7-19ee-45c4-a095-132eca8b851e" />  

Black Box = Testing what it does
→ You don’t see the code; you test inputs and outputs.

White Box = Testing how it works
→ You look inside the code and test its internal logic.

---

## 🤝 What is Pair Programming?

Pair programming involves two developers working side-by-side, either physically or virtually, to enhance collaboration and communication.
It allows for continuous planning and discussion, often leading to a better end product.


- **Driver/Navigator**  
- **Ping-Pong (TDD-based)**  
- **Strong Style (mentor/learner)**  

✅ Benefits: Knowledge sharing, better code, soft skills  
⚠️ Challenges: Fatigue, dominance, scheduling conflicts  

## 👥 Pair Programming Styles

### 1. Driver / Navigator
- **Driver**  
  - The one typing the code.  
  - Focuses on the mechanics (syntax, structure, implementation).  

- **Navigator**  
  - Reviews in real time.  
  - Thinks about direction, catches mistakes, considers design, architecture, and edge cases.  

🔄 They **swap roles regularly** to keep both developers engaged.  

---

### 2. Ping-Pong (TDD-based)
- Based on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.  
- **Workflow**:  
  1. Developer A writes a **failing test**.  
  2. Developer B writes the **code to make it pass**.  
  3. Developer B then writes the **next failing test**.  
  4. Developer A writes the **code to pass it**.  

⚡ Keeps both developers active and ensures **tests drive the design**.  

---

### 3. Strong Style (Mentor/Learner)
- Popularized by **Llewellyn Falco**.  
- **Rule**:  
  > “For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands.”  

- **Used in Mentorship**:  
  - **Mentor (Navigator):** Guides, explains concepts, suggests approaches.  
  - **Learner (Driver):** Writes the actual code, gaining hands-on experience.  

✅ Ensures the learner is **actively coding**, not just watching.  


---

## 🚀 CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Delivery/Deployment)
- **CI**: Frequent merges, automated builds/tests  
- **CD**: Automated deploys to staging/production  

**Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel, WebAssembly  
**Package Managers**: npm, Pip, Maven, Homebrew, etc.  

---

## 🏗️ What is a Software Stack?
A combination of front-end, back-end, database, and infrastructure technologies.  

**Popular Stacks**  
- **LAMP** – Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP  
- **MEAN** – MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js  
- **MERN** – MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js  
- **MEVN** – MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js  
- **Python-Django** – Python, Django, SQL  
- **Ruby on Rails** – Ruby, Rails, SQL  

✅ Benefits: Fast dev, reusable code, open-source support  
⚠️ Challenges: Scalability, ecosystem maturity, dependency management  

---


## 🔠 High-Level vs. Low-Level Programming Languages  

### High-Level Languages  
- Use English-like syntax, easy to read, write, and debug.  
- Portable across platforms.  
- **Examples**: SQL, Pascal, Python.  

### Low-Level Languages  
- Closer to machine code, harder for humans to read.  
- Tied to specific hardware architectures.  
- **Example**: Assembly (ARM, MIPS, X86).  

### Query Languages  
- Specialized for interacting with databases.  
- Perform **CRUD** operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete.  
- Require compatible syntax between database and application.  
- **Examples**: SQL (most common), AQL, CQL, Datalog.  

### Assembly Languages  
- Low-level, uses **mnemonics (short codes)** for machine instructions.  
- Hardware-specific: each CPU has its own assembly language.  
- Requires an **assembler** to convert code into machine instructions.  
- Typically: **one assembly instruction = one machine instruction**.  

---

## 🧮 Key Programming Logic Concepts  

### 1. Boolean Expressions and Variables  
- **Boolean Expression**: statement evaluating to `true` or `false`.  
- **Variable**: holds a value that can change during execution.  
- **Role**: control program flow and decisions.  

### 2. Branching (Decision-Making Logic)  
- Chooses execution paths based on conditions.  
- **Constructs**:  
  - `if` → executes code if condition is true.  
  - `if-then-else` → executes one block if true, another if false.  
  - `switch` → selects from multiple values.  
  - `goto` → jumps to another line (rare today).  
- **Use Case**: deciding which action to take.  

### 3. Looping (Repetition Logic)  
- Repeats instructions until a condition is met.  
- **Types**:  
  - `while` → entry-controlled.  
  - `for` → fixed number of iterations.  
  - `do-while` → exit-controlled (runs at least once).  
- **Use Case**: repeating actions multiple times.  

**Difference**  
- **Branching** → controls *path*.  
- **Looping** → controls *repetition*.  

---

## 📝 Programming Concepts  

1. **Identifiers** → names for program components (variables, classes, methods).  
2. **Constants** → fixed values that don’t change (e.g., `PI`, `tax_rate`).  
3. **Variables** → values that change during execution (`age`, `username`).  
4. **Containers** → hold multiple elements:  
   - **Array** → fixed size, same type, indexed.  
   - **Vector** → dynamic size, flexible but slower.  

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Identifiers → Names  
- Constants → Fixed values  
- Variables → Changeable values  
- Arrays → Fixed-size collections  
- Vectors → Dynamic-size collections  

---

## 🏗️ Approaches to Application Architecture  

### Component Characteristics  
- Reusability  
- Replaceability  
- Independence  
- Extensibility  
- Encapsulation  
- Non-Context Specific  

### Component-Based Architecture  
- Breaks system into logical, independent components within one app.  
- **Focus**: modularity.  

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)  
- Breaks system into services reused across multiple apps.  
- **Focus**: interoperability.  

**Analogy**:  
- Component-Based → Car with replaceable parts.  
- SOA → Taxi service available to many users.  

### Distributed Systems  
- Multiple computers work together as one system.  
- **Features**: fault tolerance, scalability, efficiency.  
- **Example**: Netflix.  

---

## 🏛️ Architectural Patterns in Software  

## 1. 2-Tier (Client–Server)  
**Explanation:**  
The system is split into two layers:  
- **Client** → Handles user interaction (UI, forms, input).  
- **Server** → Manages data, logic, and storage.  

They communicate directly with each other.  

**Analogy:**  
Imagine a **restaurant**:  
- You (the client) place an order.  
- The **chef** (server) prepares your meal and serves it back.  

Simple, but if too many customers arrive at once, the chef can easily get overwhelmed.  

<img width="411" height="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc1df7e-07e6-457e-87a5-e4aa18e48de6" />


---

## 2. 3-Tier (N-Tier)  
**Explanation:**  
Adds an extra layer between client and server. Typically:  
- **Presentation layer** → UI.  
- **Application layer** → Business logic.  
- **Data layer** → Database.  

**Analogy:**  
Think of a **restaurant with a waiter**:  
- You (client) tell the **waiter** (application layer) your order.  
- The waiter communicates it to the **chef** (data layer).  
- The chef cooks it, gives it to the waiter, who serves it back to you.  

This structure is more **organized and scalable**.  

<img width="342" height="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab49ef60-ca07-4fad-9bc4-fa9c86fb11e1" />


---

## 3. Peer-to-Peer (P2P)  
**Explanation:**  
Every participant (peer) is both a **client and a server**. No central authority is required. (Decentralized network of nodes that behave as both client and server.)

**Analogy:**  
Like a **potluck dinner**:  
- Everyone brings food (data) and also eats.  
- If you want something, you ask another guest directly.  

**Examples:** BitTorrent, blockchain.  

<img width="398" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb2c413-d1e4-4761-bc47-39fa73ec9120" />


---

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)  
**Explanation:**  
The system reacts to **events**. Components don’t continuously check for updates — they respond only when something happens.  

**Analogy:**  
Think of a **doorbell system**:  
- The delivery person presses your bell (event).  
- You respond only when it rings.  

This makes systems more **efficient and decoupled**.  

<img width="502" height="157" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b880ed-a28c-4f49-a23e-a93e18e6d067" />

---

## 5. Microservices  
**Explanation:**  
The application is divided into small, independent services. Each one has a single responsibility and communicates through APIs.  

**Analogy:**  
A **shopping mall**:  
- Each store (microservice) runs independently — clothing, food, electronics.  
- Together, they form the full mall (application).  
- If one shop closes, the rest continue working.

<img width="497" height="226" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d1961a6-c077-4100-86f8-c8829bed076d" />


---

## 6. Model-View-Controller (MVC)  
**Explanation:**  
Divides the application into three main components:  
- **Model** → Manages data and business rules.  
- **View** → Displays information (UI).  
- **Controller** → Handles input and coordinates between Model and View.  

**Analogy:**  
A **news broadcast team**:  
- **Journalists (Model)** gather information.  
- **Producer (Controller)** decides what goes on air.  
- **Anchor (View)** presents it to the audience.  

---

## 7. Message-Broker  
**Explanation:**  
Acts as a **middleman** to exchange messages between services. This prevents direct coupling.  

**Analogy:**  
A **post office**:  
- You drop off a letter (message).  
- The post office (broker) delivers it to the right person.  
- Sender and receiver don’t need to be connected at the same time.  

**Examples:** Kafka, RabbitMQ.  

---

## 8. Blackboard  
**Explanation:**  
Components share knowledge by writing to a **common data space (blackboard)**. Other components read it and contribute when relevant.  

**Analogy:**  
A **classroom blackboard**:  
- Students (components) write their part of the solution.  
- Others build on it until the problem is solved.  

Often used in **AI and knowledge-based systems**.  

---

## 9. Pipe-and-Filter  
**Explanation:**  
Data flows through a sequence of **filters** (processing steps) connected by **pipes**. Each filter transforms the data before passing it along.  

**Analogy:**  
A **car factory assembly line**:  
- Each station (filter) performs one step — painting, adding wheels, installing seats.  
- The product (data) moves along the line until it’s complete.  

Useful for **streaming and data transformations**.  

---

## 10. Controller-Responder  
**Explanation:**  
A controller processes input, determines what to do, and passes it to a responder, which generates the output. Similar to MVC but focused on **request-response interactions**.  

**Analogy:**  
A **call center**:  
- You (client) explain your issue to the **agent (controller)**.  
- The agent looks up the solution and the **responder** communicates it back.  

Keeps a clear separation between **decision-making** and **response delivery**.  
---

## ⚙️ Pre-Production Environments  

- **Development** → coding phase.  
- **QA** → testing environment.  
- **Staging** → production-like, for final testing.  
- **Production** → live environment for users.  

### Deployment Options  
- **On-Premises** → secure, costly.  
- **Cloud (Public/Private/Hybrid)** → scalable, flexible.  

---

## 🖥️ Production Deployment Components  

### N-Tier Architecture  
- **Presentation Tier** → front-end.  
- **Web Tier** → load balancer + web servers.  
- **Application Tier** → app servers + business logic.  
- **Data Tier** → database servers.  

### Key Components  
- **Firewall** → protects traffic.  
- **Load Balancer** → distributes requests.  
- **Proxy Server** → caching, filtering, encryption.  
- **Servers**:  
  - Web Server → static content.  
  - Application Server → business logic.  
  - Database Server → data storage.
