## 💡 What is Software Engineering?
- **Definition**: Applying scientific principles to design, build, and test software systematically.  
- **Purpose**: Collect and analyze business requirements → create reliable software solutions.  

---

## 🕰️ History & Evolution
- **1950s–1960s**: Ad hoc, no formal process.  
- **1960s–1980s**: “Software Crisis” — over budget, late delivery, buggy systems.  
- **Solution**: Introduce engineering discipline → structured methods + CASE tools.  

**CASE Tool Categories**  
- Business analysis & modeling  
- Development tools (debugging, IDEs)  
- Verification & validation  
- Configuration management  
- Metrics & measurement  
- Project management

## 👩‍💻 Software Engineer vs. Software Developer
| Role               | Focus | Scope | Responsibilities |
|--------------------|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Software Engineer** | System-level | Broad | Designs, builds, maintains whole systems; large-scale projects |
| **Software Developer** | Code/functionality | Narrower | Implements specific features; often smaller, creative problem-solving tasks |

## 🔄 Modern Practices & SDLC
Software development today is guided by the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  

**Phases**: Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

## 🛠️ Building Quality Software – Key Points
1. Requirements Gathering  
2. Design (system architecture, APIs, UI, DB)  
3. Coding for Quality (standards, patterns, linters, documentation)  
4. Testing (unit → integration → system → UAT)  
5. Releases (Alpha → Beta → GA)  
6. Documentation (system + user docs)  

---

## 📝 Welcome to Requirements
Steps: Identify stakeholders → Define goals → Set objectives → Elicit → Document → Confirm/Prioritize  

**Key Requirement Documents**  
- **SRS** (Software Requirement Specification)  
- **URS** (User Requirement Specification)  
- **SysRS** (System Requirement Specification)  

---

## ⚙️ Software Development Methodologies Overview
- **Waterfall Model** – Sequential, rigid, long release cycles  
- **V-Shape Model** – Emphasizes testing, rigid  
- **Agile Model** – Iterative, flexible, feedback-driven  

---

## 🧪 Software Testing
- **Functional Testing** – verifies requirements  
- **Non-Functional Testing** – performance, scalability, security  
- **Regression Testing** – ensures new changes don’t break old features

## 📖 Software Documentation Overview
- **Product Documentation**: requirements, design, technical docs  
- **Process Documentation**: SOPs, workflow instructions  
- **User Documentation**: guides, FAQs, tutorials  

---

## 👥 Roles in Software Engineering Projects
- Project Manager / Scrum Master – Oversees planning, timelines, and team coordination; ensures the project follows Agile or chosen methodology.
- Stakeholders – Individuals or groups (clients, users, executives) who have an interest in the project’s outcome and provide requirements/feedback.
- System / Software Architect – Designs the overall structure of the system, choosing technologies, patterns, and ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- UX Designer – Focuses on user research, wireframes, and design to ensure the product is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing.
- Software Developer – Writes the actual code, implements features, fixes bugs, and collaborates on solutions with the team.
- QA / Tester – Validates that the software meets requirements by running manual and automated tests; ensures quality and reliability.
- SRE / Ops Engineer – Manages infrastructure, deployment, and system reliability; monitors performance and handles incident response.
- Product Manager / Owner – Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, manages the backlog, and aligns the team with business goals.
- Technical Writer – Creates clear documentation such as user guides, API docs, and process manuals to support developers and end-users.

✅ Benefits: Knowledge sharing, better code, soft skills  
⚠️ Challenges: Fatigue, dominance, scheduling conflicts  

---

## 🚀 CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Delivery/Deployment)
- **CI**: Frequent merges, automated builds/tests  
- **CD**: Automated deploys to staging/production  

**Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel, WebAssembly  
**Package Managers**: npm, Pip, Maven, Homebrew, etc.  

---

## 🏗️ What is a Software Stack?
A combination of front-end, back-end, database, and infrastructure technologies.  

**Popular Stacks**  
- **LAMP** – Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP  
- **MEAN** – MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js  
- **MERN** – MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js  
- **MEVN** – MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js  
- **Python-Django** – Python, Django, SQL  
- **Ruby on Rails** – Ruby, Rails, SQL  

✅ Benefits: Fast dev, reusable code, open-source support  
⚠️ Challenges: Scalability, ecosystem maturity, dependency management
